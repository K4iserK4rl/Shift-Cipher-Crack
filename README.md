# Shift-Cipher-Crack

Starts by printing the original ciphertext. Next, the top 5 most frequently occuring ciphertext letters and number of occurrences. Based on the top 5 occurring letters, prints the potential key (shift amount) for mapping to plaintext 'e', the ngram (english_monogram) fitness score for that key, and the plaintext message recovered using that key value. Finally, prints the best ngram score, the correct key, and the recovered plaintext.
